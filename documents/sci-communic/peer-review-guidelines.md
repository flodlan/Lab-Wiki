# Peer Review Guidelines
This page outlines the most important points to focus on when peer reviewing another lab member's work. This is only a rough guideline as the specific structure of the paper will highly depend on the requirements of the journal and the topic of your fellow researcher. 

**Important to keep in mind** is that the goal of the internal peer review process is to assist your lab member in improving their paper, rather than judging or criticizng their work.
