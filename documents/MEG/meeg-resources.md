The following section will provide with useful resources when starting with M/EEG analyses. Mostly, links to tutorials, lectures and relevant software for the different analysis.

## Software

The main software used by the members of the Predictive Brain Lab to do M/EEG analysis is the following:
* [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) - **MATLAB** software toolbox for MEG, EEG and iEEG analysis. This is the **default** software being used given that it is developed at the Donders and they provide support for it.
* [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html#) - Open-source **Python** package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data: MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, NIRS, and more
* [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) - EEGLAB is an interactive **Matlab** toolbox for processing continuous and event-related EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data

> You can ask other lab members if they have pro's and con's regarding their software selection before deciding what to use. It may be the case that specific software is better for some analysis compared to others. 

## General Resources

### Toolbox
 - The Donders Institute offers hands-on annual courses to get acquainted with some of the most recent neuroimaging techniques. Experts on the field working at the insitute guide these several day workshops. 
You can find the current schedule [here](https://www.ru.nl/en/donders-institute/services/donders-toolkits).

> Ask other lab members for their experience with these courses. Additionally, you might want to consider looking at the software being used during these toolkits as it might not match with your experience or goals.

### Books
* [Analyzing Neural Time Series Data (Theory and Practice)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262019873/analyzing-neural-time-series-data/)  - This book offers a comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of analyzing electrical brain signals. It explains the conceptual, mathematical, and implementational (via Matlab programming) aspects of time-, time-frequency- and synchronization-based analyses of magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), and local field potential (LFP) recordings from humans and nonhuman animals.
* [An Introduction to the Event-Related Potential Technique, Second Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525855/an-introduction-to-the-event-related-potential-technique/) - Very useful book to understand better the computations behind ERPs in EEG data.
* [MEG: An Introduction to Methods](https://academic.oup.com/book/9980)
* [Magnetoencephalography - From Signals to Dynamic Cortical Networks](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-33045-2)

### Articles
#### MEG
* [Magnetoencephalography for brain electrophysiology and imaging - Baillet (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4504). A great review on the aspects that uniquely characterize magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the brain.
* [The brain in time: insights from neuromagnetic recordings - Hari et al. (2010)](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05438.x). A nice introduction to MEG recordings.
 
#### EEG
