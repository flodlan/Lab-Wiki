## Preparing Experimental Designs
**Following initial study design**
* Presentation on the General Lab Meeting to get feedback on initial study design
* Test scripts, equipment, tasks, and procedures with a small pilot (see [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5960) for rules about pilot designs at DCCN and [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=laboratories) on how to book a lab)
* Present your work and proposal to Donders in a [PPM](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=research-ppm) (see below)
* Test again using a more extensive pilot (if necessary)

**After finalizing design**
* Set up your study on SONA, the university's recruitment platform (info [here](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=recruiting-paying-subjects))
* Set up specific time slots in SONA.
* Book MRI/MEG/behavioral cubicle slot (+ [support from research assistant](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=5533) if required)
* Open slot on SONA
* Add time slots to your personalized or shared Google Calendar (if you have one)
* Set up [Castor](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=castor), an online platform to keep track of all relevant documents of participants in your study
* Print the necessary [Informed Consent Forms](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6769) & [Subject Information Packages](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=6770) (Check that you are **always** using the last version of these forms)
* Familiarize yourself with the [data management procedure](https://intranet.donders.ru.nl/index.php?id=datastorage-archiving-sharing)

**When starting testing**
* Take a look at the [concept checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSTiefJdUuVGoO00uoj6vZxGBkfi-IeamdLvl56VwdY/edit?usp=sharing) and alter according to your own interests. It is always a good idea to make sure everything is as standarized as possible.
